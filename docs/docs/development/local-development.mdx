# Local Development

<Prerequisites />

Once your app is bootstrapped according to the [Manual quick start](../index.md#manual-quick-start) guide, you can start the development server with hot reload for both UI and backend code.

In the application root directory, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server with hot reload for both UI and backend code. Open the displayed URL in your browser to see the app. Modify the code in the `src/` directory to see the changes reflected in the browser.

To see the other available commands, read the `README.md` file in the application root directory.
