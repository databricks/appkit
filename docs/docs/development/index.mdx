# Development

AppKit provides multiple development workflows to suit different needs: local development with hot reload, AI-assisted development with MCP, and remote tunneling to deployed backends.

<Prerequisites />

## Development flows

There are multiple supported development flows available with AppKit:

1. **[Local development](./local-development.mdx)**: Run the development server with hot reload for both UI and backend code. This is the default development flow and is suitable for most use cases.
2. **[AI-assisted development](./ai-assisted-development.mdx)**: Use an AI coding assistant connected via the Databricks MCP server to explore data, run CLI commands, and scaffold your app interactively.
3. **[Remote Bridge](./remote-bridge.mdx)**: Create a remote bridge to a deployed backend while keeping your queries and UI local. This is useful for testing against production data or debugging deployed backend code without redeploying your app.
