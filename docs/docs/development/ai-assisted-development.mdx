# AI-Assisted development

<Prerequisites />

AppKit integrates with AI coding assistants through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Installing MCP server

To install the Databricks MCP server for your preferred AI assistant, run:

```bash
databricks experimental apps-mcp install
```

## MCP capabilities

The MCP server exposes the following capabilities for AI assistants:

- **Data exploration**: Query catalogs, schemas, tables, and execute SQL
- **CLI command execution**: Deploy and manage apps, and run other workspace operations
- **Workspace resource discovery**: Inspect and navigate workspace resources

## Example prompts

Here are some basic examples you can use to explore your app and workspace:

1. Creating a new basic app
  ```
  Create a new Databricks app that displays a dashboard of the users table in main.default.
  ```
1. Introspecting a table schema
  ```
  Show me the schema of the users table in main.default.
  ```
1. Creating a new query
  ```
  Create a new query to find users created in the last 7 days.
  ```
1. Deploying an app
  ```
  Deploy the app to Databricks with the name "my-app".
  ```

Possibilities are virtually endless. Ask your AI assistant to help you with your app and workspace.

## LLM resources

AppKit provides specialized guidance files to help AI coding assistants work more effectively with the projects.

If you're building applications using AppKit packages, reference the **[llms.txt](https://github.com/databricks/appkit/blob/main/llms.txt)** file.
