# @databricks/appkit-ui

The library provides a set of UI primitives for building Databricks apps in [React](https://react.dev/).

The full list of components is available in the UI components section. Use the component list to inspect props, events, and examples for every exported primitive.

## UI components

The UI components and their examples originate from the [Shadcn UI](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) project.

## Data components

The data components are built on top of the [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/) library.

They support both query mode (queryKey + parameters) and data mode (static data).
