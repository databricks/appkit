# @databricks/appkit-ui

The library provides a set of UI primitives for building Databricks apps in [React](https://react.dev/).

The full list of components is available in the UI components section. Use the component list to inspect props, events, and examples for every exported primitive.

The components and their examples originate from the [Shadcn UI](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) project.
