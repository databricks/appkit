# App management

Manage your AppKit application throughout its lifecycle using the Databricks CLI. This guide covers deploying, starting, stopping, monitoring, and deleting apps.

<Prerequisites />

## Create app

See the [Quick start](./index.md) section to create a new Databricks app with AppKit installed.

## Configuration

Before deploying your app, you need to configure it. See the [Configuration guide](./configuration.mdx) for details on:
- `app.yaml` configuration and command specification
- Environment variables and SQL warehouse binding
- Local development authentication options

## Deploy app

Deploy your AppKit application using the automated deployment pipeline:

```bash
databricks apps deploy
```

This command runs a complete deployment pipeline:
1. Builds the frontend (`npm run build`)
2. Deploys the bundle to the workspace
3. Runs the app

:::note

For all available options, run:
```bash
databricks apps deploy --help
```
:::

### Examples

- Deploy to a specific target:

    ```bash
    databricks apps deploy --target prod
    ```

- Deploy with custom variables:

    ```bash
    databricks apps deploy --var="warehouse_id=abc123"
    ```

- Skip the build step for faster iteration:

    ```bash
    databricks apps deploy --skip-build
    ```

- Force deploy (override Git branch validation):

    ```bash
    databricks apps deploy --force
    ```

## Start app

To start a stopped app, run:

```bash
databricks apps start {name}
```

## Stop app

Stop a running app without deleting it:

```bash
databricks apps stop {name}
```

## List all apps

```bash
databricks apps list
```

## Get detailed app information

```bash
databricks apps get {name}
```

## Stream app Logs

Stream application logs in real-time:

```bash
databricks apps logs {name}
```

By default, this shows the most recent 200 log lines and exits.

> **Note:** For all available options, run `databricks apps logs --help`

### Examples

- Show the last 50 log lines:

    ```bash
    databricks apps logs my-app --tail-lines 50
    ```

- Follow logs with a search filter:

    ```bash
    databricks apps logs my-app --follow --search ERROR
    ```

- Filter logs by source:

    ```bash
    databricks apps logs my-app --follow --source APP
    ```

- Save logs to a file:

    ```bash
    databricks apps logs my-app --follow --output-file app.log
    ```

- Stream logs for 5 minutes:

    ```bash
    databricks apps logs my-app --follow --timeout 5m
    ```

## Delete app

Permanently delete an app:

```bash
databricks apps delete {name}
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This action cannot be undone. All app data and configurations will be removed.
