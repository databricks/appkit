# App Management

Manage your AppKit application throughout its lifecycle using the Databricks CLI. This guide covers deploying, starting, stopping, monitoring, and deleting apps.

<Prerequisites />

## Create App

See the [Quick start](./index.md#quick-start-options) section to create a new Databricks app with AppKit installed.

## Configuration

Before deploying your app, configure it according to your needs. See the [Databricks Apps Configuration](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/configuration) documentation for details on:

- App configuration file (`app.yaml`)
- Environment variables
- Authorization and permissions
- Networking configuration

## Deploy App

Deploy your AppKit application using the automated deployment pipeline:

```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy
```

This command runs a complete deployment pipeline:
1. Builds the frontend (`npm run build`)
2. Deploys the bundle to the workspace
3. Runs the app

:::note

For all available options, run:
```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy --help
```
:::

### Examples

Deploy to the default target:

```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy
```

Deploy to a specific target:

```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy --target prod
```

Deploy with custom variables:

```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy --var="warehouse_id=abc123"
```

Skip the build step for faster iteration:

```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy --skip-build
```

Force deploy (override Git branch validation):

```bash
databricks experimental dev app deploy --force
```

## Start App

To start a stopped app, run:

```bash
databricks apps start {name}
```

## Stop App

Stop a running app without deleting it:

```bash
databricks apps stop {name}
```

## List all apps

```bash
databricks apps list
```

## Get detailed app information

```bash
databricks apps get {name}
```

## Stream App Logs

Stream application logs in real-time:

```bash
databricks apps logs {name}
```

By default, this shows the most recent 200 log lines and exits.

> **Note:** For all available options, run `databricks apps logs --help`

### Examples

Show the last 50 log lines:

```bash
databricks apps logs my-app --tail-lines 50
```

Follow logs with a search filter:

```bash
databricks apps logs my-app --follow --search ERROR
```

Filter logs by source:

```bash
databricks apps logs my-app --follow --source APP
```

Save logs to a file:

```bash
databricks apps logs my-app --follow --output-file app.log
```

Stream logs for 5 minutes:

```bash
databricks apps logs my-app --follow --timeout 5m
```

## Delete App

Permanently delete an app:

```bash
databricks apps delete {name}
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This action cannot be undone. All app data and configurations will be removed.
