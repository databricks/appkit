## Introduction

AppKit is a TypeScript SDK for building production-ready Databricks applications with a plugin-based architecture. It provides opinionated defaults, built-in observability, and seamless integration with Databricks services.

AppKit simplifies building data applications on Databricks by providing:

- **Plugin architecture**: Modular design with built-in server and analytics plugins
- **Type safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with automatic query type generation
- **Production-ready features**: Built-in caching, telemetry, retry logic, and error handling
- **Developer experience**: Remote hot reload, file-based queries, optimized for AI-assisted development
- **Databricks native**: Seamless integration with SQL Warehouses, Unity Catalog, and other workspace resources
